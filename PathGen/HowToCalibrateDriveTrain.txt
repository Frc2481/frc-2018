How to calibrate drivetrain without logging data and analyzing in MATLAB...
1. Modify code to only use one wheel to estimate pose.
2. Zero robot pose, drive robot slowly in straight line, measure distance traveled.
3. Calibrate wheel steering angle offset until pose estimate is straight line.
4. Calibrate wheel diameter until pose estimate distance traveled is correct.
5. Repeat for all wheels.
6. Modify code to use all wheels to estimate pose.

How to calibrate drivetrain by logging data and analyzing in MATLAB...
1. Log drivetrain sensors, drive robot slowly in straight line, measure distance traveled.
2. Analyze pose estimate using one wheel in MATLAB and calibrate wheel steering angle offset until pose estimate is straight line.
3. Analyze pose estimate using one wheel in MATLAB and calibrate wheel diameter until pose estimate distance traveled is correct.
4. Repeat for all wheels.
